--------------

#####Task List

 - [ ] Write a program to read a given binary image and convert it into its negative image.
 - [ ] Write a program to read a given grayscale image and convert it into its negative image.
 - [ ] Write a program to apply log transformation on grayscale images.
 - [ ] Write a program to apply power law transformation on a grayscale image varying parameter range to produced different output images for the same input image.
 - [ ] Write a program to covert grayscale image into binary image varying different threshold values. (many output images will be produced for one input image for different threshold values)
 - [ ] Write a program to segment the grayscale image in different regions using gray level transformation.
 - [ ] Write a program to enhance the low contrast image to high contrast image using linear stretching method.
 - [ ]  Write a program to enhance the low contrast image to high contrast image using non-linear stretching method.
 - [ ]  Write a program to find the histogram of a image and then plot the histogram.
 - [ ]  Write a program to enhance the low contrast image to high contrast image using Histogram equalization.
 - [ ]  Write a program to enhance the low contrast image to high contrast image using Histogram specification.
 - [ ]  Write a program to remove the noise using averaging filtering technique from a given noisy image.
 - [ ]  Write a program to remove the noise using weighted averaging filtering technique from noisy image.
 - [ ]  Write a program to remove the impulsive noise using median filtering technique.
 - [ ]  Write a program to enhance a given image using min filter.
 - [ ]  Write a program to enhance the image using max filter.
 - [ ]  Write a program to enhance the image using unsharp masking and High-boost filtering.
 - [ ]  Write a program to enhance the image using 1st order derivative filtering.
 - [ ]  Write a program to enhance the image using 2nd order derivative filtering.
 - [ ]  Write a program to enhance the image using Robert Operator.
 - [ ]  Write a program in MATLAB to enhance the image using Prewitt Operator.
