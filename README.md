#####Task List

 - [x] 1. Write a program to read a given binary image and convert it into its negative image. 
 - [x] 2. Write a program to read a given grayscale image and convert it into its negative image. 
 - [x] 3. Write a program to apply log transformation on grayscale images. 
 - [x] 4. Write a program to apply power law transformation on a grayscale image varying parameter range to produced different output images for the same input image. 
 - [x] 5. Write a program to covert grayscale image into binary image varying different threshold values. (many output images will be produced for one input image for different threshold values) 
 - [ ] 6. Write a program to segment the grayscale image in different regions using gray level transformation. 
 - [x] 7. Write a program to enhance the low contrast image to high contrast image using linear stretching method. 
 - [ ] 8. Write a program to enhance the low contrast image to high contrast image using non-linear stretching method. 
 - [x] 9. Write a program to find the histogram of a image and then plot the histogram. 
 - [x] 10. Write a program to enhance the low contrast image to high contrast image using Histogram equalization.  
 - [ ] 11. Write a program to enhance the low contrast image to high contrast image using Histogram specification.   
 - [x] 12. Write a program to remove the noise using averaging filtering technique from a given noisy image.  
 - [x] 13. Write a program to remove the noise using weighted averaging filtering technique from noisy image.  
 - [x] 14. Write a program to remove the impulsive noise using median filtering technique.  
 - [x] 15. Write a program to enhance a given image using min filter.  
 - [x] 16. Write a program to enhance the image using max filter.  
 - [x] 17. Write a program to enhance the image using unsharp masking and High-boost filtering.  
 - [x] 18. Write a program to enhance the image using 1st order derivative filtering.  
 - [x] 19. Write a program to enhance the image using 2nd order derivative filtering.
